# KERNEL
The kernel is a program inside the **operational system** that has a controll over the all system and gives a safe access to the hardware, supervising the process and the organizzation of every data of the computers, the kernel is the **interface between hardware and software** and is responsible for the trasmission and mediation of commands\

## Structure
The kernel has always the same structures and consist of severals layers 
1. layer: there is the **interface with the hardware**.
2. layer: there is **memory management** responsible for the distribution of RAM.
3. layer: there is **process management** (scheduler) which deals with **time managemnet** and thus enables multitasking.
4. layer: **management of devices**.
5. layer: **file system** here, processes are assigned to their respective areas on the main memory or hard disk.

All this process is done in the background, the kernel is not the ISA because ISA are the istruction that the CPU can do instead the kernel tell the cpu what do
