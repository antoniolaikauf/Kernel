# KERNEL
The kernel is a program inside the **operational system** that has a control over the all system and gives a safe access to the hardware, supervising the process and the organizzation of every data of the computers, the kernel is the **interface between hardware (RAM, CPU ...) and software (applications, web browser ...)** and because of this is the first program to be load and the last program to be closed\

the kernel is responsable for managing and allocating computer resources, allow other applications and programs to use these resources. 
The main tasks of a kernel are: **process management**, **memory management**, **input and output communication management**, **management of hardware components** 

## Structure
The kernel has always the same structures and consist of severals layers 
1. layer: there is the **interface with the hardware**.
2. layer: there is **memory management** responsible for the distribution of RAM.
3. layer: there is **process management** (scheduler) which deals with **time managemnet** and thus enables multitasking.
4. layer: **management of devices**.
5. layer: **file system** here, processes are assigned to their respective areas on the main memory or hard disk.

## Scheduler

A true scheduler must manage various operations on processes, such as **creation**, **termination**, **suspension**, and **resumption**.
Modern operating systems often use priority to determine the order in which processes are executed, **processes can be interrupted to move on to others with a higher priority.**

All this process is done in the background, the kernel is not the ISA because ISA are the istruction that the CPU can do instead the kernel tell the cpu what do and this process bring a better organization and performance  


**scheduler round robin**
![](img/R.jpg)

after the arrival time is pass the process is put inside the ready queue, that is why there are two time p1,p1 at the start because the process2 is put into the queue after 5s 

the round robin is a scheduler that is based on **FIFO (first in first out)** and ensures that each process is executed fairly t does not take into account the specific needs of processes, such as their urgency or importance.
Introduzione della Priorit√†


**scheduler with priority** es. **Shortest Job First (SJF)**
![](img/QRlKw.gif)

all process in order \
|p1|p1|p2|p3|p4|p5|p1|p2|p3|p4|p5|p2|p3|p4|p5|p2|p3|p4|p5|p2|p3|p3|\
0  4  8 12 16  20 24 28 32 36 40 44 48 52 56 60 64 68 69 72 75 79 80

Instead of a simple FIFO queue, processes can be placed in a priority queue. In this queue, processes with a higher priority are executed before those with a lower priority, regardless of their order of arrival.
If a high-priority process arrives while a low-priority process is running, the system can interrupt (preempt) the running process and give precedence to the high-priority process.


# Type of kernel 
there are four categories of kernel 
- **kernel monolitici** 

  Is a single enity that manages all the function of the operating system, such as memory management, process management and comunication between the various hardware components. This kind of kernel is very fast 
- **microkernel**

  The microkernel is designed to be as small as possible, delegating many of its functions to external modules operating is 'userpace'. This approach reduces the compleity of the kernel and increases stability, however comunication between the various modules may be slower.  
- **kernel ibrido**

  Combines elements of monolithic kernels and microkernels.
- **esokernel** 

  focuses on etremely low resources managements
- **nanokernel**
  
  give direct access to the hardware
